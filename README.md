# Notion Color Thumbnails
Notion is dumb - requires you to upload images of solid colors to add to design systems. A better idea would've been a color selection tool and generate those images within the app. 

Deployed to [http://color-thumbnail.herokuapp.com/](http://color-thumbnail.herokuapp.com/) for now, add a hex to the end of the URL and place that URL in the image URL section in Notion to automatically generate an image for the color you want without actually leaving the Notion app or manually uploading anything. Not entering a hex number just generates something randomly.
